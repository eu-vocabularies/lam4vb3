    <p>This methodology presents and describes the use of metadata elements that are relevant for the legal and
        documentary
        analysis of the EUR-Lex website's content.</p>
    <p>The metadata elements listed in this document are taken from the Common Data Model (CDM) of the CELLAR
        repository
        of
        the Publications Office.</p>
    <p>The CELLAR is an electronic database which contains the documents and their related metadata diffused on one
        of
        the
        websites of the Publications Office. The CDM is an ontology that describes the concepts and relationships
        (properties/elements) that can exist for the data stored in the CELLAR.
    </p>
    <p>This document does not contain all the properties of the CDM, but only those that are used in the context of
        the
        legal and documentary analysis. The purpose of this selection is to facilitate the understanding and the use
        of
        the
        relevant CDM properties; however, it is necessary to be familiar with the whole structure of the CDM. The
        CDM â€“
        which is the primary source for the concepts and relations present in the CELLAR - is available in rdf
        format.
        Its
        documentation is available in html format.</p>
    <p>This methodology gives some basic Definition for the metadata elements, determines their cardinality and
        lists
        the
        related properties. It also gives some methodological rules concerning the use of the elements in different
        contexts
        during the legal analysis.</p>
    <p>The document also describes which kind of data has to be used when filling in the metadata elements. If a
        metadata
        element has to be completed with a value coming from a controlled vocabulary, it is indicated. If there is
        no
        indication, it means that the metadata element can be filled in with free text.</p>
    <p>Controlled vocabularies may have different forms, such as thesauri (e.g. EuroVoc), classifications (e.g.
        Directory
        codes), authority tables (e.g. Resource types, Corporates bodies), Translation tables (e.g. FD_375), etc.
        The
        Publications Office manages and provides several kinds of controlled vocabularies in order to harmonise and
        standardise the use of the codes and their associated labels.</p>
    <p>The MDR website of the Publications Office contains a number of Named Authority Lists (NAL's), also known as
        (Common) Authority Tables (CAT's) and some Translation tables (FD tables) as well. They are available in
        several
        formats (SKOS, XML, HTML) and contain a closed list of language independent codes and their associated
        labels in
        each linguistic version.</p>
    <p> EuroVoc, the EU's multilingual and multidisciplinary thesaurus is a special controlled vocabulary which is
        used
        for
        content indexation. It is also available and downloadable from the MDR website, but has its own website as
        well.
    </p>


    <p>The values that are put in the metadata elements are used for search purposes in the database and especially
        on
        EUR-Lex. The legal and documentary analysis of documents diffused on EUR-Lex serves this purpose: the
        objective
        is
        to assign to the documents as many relevant metadata as necessary in order to facilitate their retrieval
        from
        the
        database and to set up the existing relations between them. The correct and thorough legal and documentary
        analysis
        contributes to provide the users of the EUR-Lex website with high quality information on the consulted
        documents
        and
        with relevant and satisfactory search results.</p>
