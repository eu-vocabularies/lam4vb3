\label{ariaid-title13}


\subsection{Provider requirements}
\label{provider-requirements}

In order to conform to this application profile an application must be
able to provide data assets that:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  comprise statements using at least the mandatory classes and
  properties.
\item
  in addition, any of the recommended and optional properties and
  classes may be provided.
\item
  employ values from the specified controlled vocabularies on properties
  with restricted value ranges. Additional controlled vocabularies may
  be used on properties with unrestricted value ranges.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Receiver requirements}
\label{receiver-requirements}

In order to conform to this application profile an application that
receives a compliant data asset must be able to:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  process information for all mandatory classes and optionally for
  recommended and optional classes.
\item
  process information for all mandatory properties and optionally for
  recommended and optional properties.
\item
  process information for all controlled vocabularies.
\end{itemize}

"processing" means that receivers must accept incoming data and
transparently provide these data to applications and services. It does
neither imply nor prescribe what applications and services finally do
with the data (parse, convert, store, make searchable, display to users,
etc.).
