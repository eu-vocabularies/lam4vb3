\label{ariaid-title14}

Multilingual aspects related to this Application Profile concern all
properties whose contents are expressed as strings with human-readable
text. Wherever such properties are used, the string values are of one of
two types:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The string is free text. Examples are descriptions and labels. Such
  text may be translated into several languages.
\item
  The string is an appellation of a ``named entity''. Examples are names
  of organisations or persons. These names may have parallel versions in
  other languages but those versions don't need to be literal
  translations.
\end{itemize}

Wherever values of properties are expressed with either type of string,
the property can be repeated with translations in the case of free text
and with parallel versions in case of named entities. For free text, the
language tag is mandatory. For named entities, the language tag is
optional and should only be provided if the parallel version of the name
is strictly associated with a particular language. For example, the name
``European Union'' has parallel versions in all official languages of the
union, while a name like ``W3C'' is not associated with a particular
language and has no parallel versions.

How multilingual information is handled by the receiver applications,
for example in indexing and user interfaces, is outside of the scope of
this Application Profile.
