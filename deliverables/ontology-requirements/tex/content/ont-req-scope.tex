  \end{itemize}
\item

\item
  description of the metadata annotations (property annotations)
\item
  description of LD classification rules (fields to
  automatically/manually classify LDs)
\item
  description of class shapes i.e.~constraints on how the class is
  instantiated

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    e.g. specific property value, cardinality constraints, range class,
    etc.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  descriptions of LD classes and LD property groupings (table of
  contents in the LAM word document and templates in the LAM webApp

\end{itemize}
