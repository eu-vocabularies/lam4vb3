\section{Introduction}\label{ariaid-title13}

This document aims at analysing and formulating the requirements of the
LAM team regarding the data model mainly and potential future
applications. It also provides an approach for transposing the LAM from
a plain text documentation into structured data with semi-formal and
formal underpinning.

The benefit of having the LAM represented in a structured form is
enabling automation of multiple processes, such as document
classification, metadata validation, metadata enrichment, which
currently are performed manually by the OP staff or by external
contractors. Such an automation can lead to significant reductions of
cost and reduce the time needed for performing these processes.

This document does not intend to provide a detailed functional
specification for every envisaged element but rather provide a general
direction and describe the path for reaching different business and
technical objectives. The main concern, at this stage is to describe how
a LAM ontology can be created starting from the current state of affairs
presented elsewhere in this document.
