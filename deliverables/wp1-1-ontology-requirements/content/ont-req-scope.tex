\section{Scope}
\label{ariaid-title14}

The LAM model should cover similar degree of detail as in the current
documentation. It should cover the following types of information.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  description of legal document classes

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    human readable definitions and descriptions
  \item
    correspondences to other classifications (CELEX/ELI, CDM,
    ResourceType etc.) as (a) mappings and as (b) code grammars
  \item
    publication metadata
  \end{itemize}
\item
  description of document metadata properties
    \begin{itemize}
  	\item
  	human readable definitions and descriptions
  	\item
  	correspondences to formal properties defined in existing or new LAM model
  \end{itemize}
\item
  description of the metadata annotations (property annotations)
\item
  description of LD classification rules (fields hinting at how to automatically/manually classify LDs)
\item
  description of class shapes, i.e. constraints on how the class is
  instantiated

  \begin{itemize}
  \item e.g. specific property value constraints 
  \item cardinality constraints, 
  \item range class constraints, etc.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  descriptions of LD classes and LD property groupings (table of
  contents in the LAM word document and templates in the LAM webApp
  description)
\end{itemize}
