\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

The initiative for modeling the Legal Analysis Methodology (LAM) involves, among other things, a transformation step in which the LAM data represented in LAM-SKOS-AP format is transformed into a formal OWL format. 

This document explains the transformation rules that are supposed to be implemented into a transformation script. We recommend that the reader is already be familiar with the context of LAM project and the general approach presented in Deliverable WP1.1\footnote{Costetchi E., 2019, Preliminary requirements specification for the Legal Analysis Methodology models} and Deliverable WP1.2\footnote{Costetchi E., 2019, LAM-SKOS-AP: an application profile for the Legal Analysis Methodology description}.
