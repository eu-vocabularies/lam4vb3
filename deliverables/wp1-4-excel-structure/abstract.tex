\section*{Abstract}

The initiative for modeling the Legal Analysis Methodology (LAM) involves, among other things, a transformation step in which the LAM data represented in an Excel format is transformed into RDF format instantiating the LAM-SKOS-AP application profile. This document explains the structure of the Excel workbook serving as input data for the transformation script.
