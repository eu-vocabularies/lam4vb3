\title{ Deliverable number and TITLE }

%%\abstract{Quickly developing, upgrading and deploying applications is the core function of the IT industry: online content providers, network operators, CDNs, business-to-business providers, and even Internet of Things providers need to be able to quickly rollout software releases to enhance their product offerings while reducing developer time and increasing customer satisfaction.

%% Such software is typically deployed and runs on shared hardware hosted either in public, private or mobile-edge clouds or other federated infrastructures. Running software on shared hardware massively boosts efficiency but also reduces isolation.

%% When public clouds appeared, the standard unit of deployment was the virtual machine (VM). However, traditional virtual machines are heavyweight as they require a full operating system image to run; this implies that running many of them on the same hardware requires a lot of RAM and CPU cycles and can reduce performance: memory and disk space is wasted, and starting / stopping VMs takes tens of seconds in the best case, and often much longer.

%% For these reasons, the software industry has embraced containers as a replacement to VMs for a wide variety of applications, with the goal of further improving performance of shared hardware, reducing dev-ops costs and speeding-up software deployment. Despite their efficiency, containers offer poor isolation as shown by their many vulnerabilities.

%% At this point, the software world appears stuck with inherently insecure and not-so-efficient containers, because virtual machines are deemed too expensive to use in many scenarios.}
