    <section><title>From unstructured to structured data</title><p>In this
    section, we propose to approach the modelling exercise in two steps.
    First, creation of a semi-formal representation of the LAM knowledge and
    then, in an automatic or semi-automatic fashion transform it into a formal
    representation. </p><p>There are multiple methodologies for creating a
    domain model or an ontology. All of these methodologies involve the domain
    experts transmitting their knowledge to an information architect, who then
    creates a formal representation of the the received knowledge suitable for
    a particular set of tasks. One of the biggest challenges in this process
    is incremental growth of accuracy and precision of the expressed knowledge
    up to the point where statements have a single possible interpretation.
    Moreover the knowledge expressed in a formal way needs to be agreed upon
    by the consortium of experts this way becoming a shared common
    conceptualisation of the domain. </p><p>One of the requirements in the LAM
    project is to enable domain experts, i.e. people without deep training in
    knowledge engineering, to edit the LAM model directly in a structured
    manner. To make this task feasible we propose adoption of a semi-formal
    knowledge organisation language that allows for organisation of the domain
    knowledge to a degree but also allows for loose informal relations to be
    expressed. The most well known and widely adopted knowledge organisation
    models is the Simple Knowledge Organisation System (SKOS).</p><p>Once the
    LAM model is expressed in a semi-formal language it is possible, in
    automatic or semi-automatic fashion, to transform it into a formal
    ontology, the final goal of the modeling exercise, expressed in OWL2
    language. In a similar fashion reference documentation of the model can
    also be generated. Moreover, because the LAM description comprises
    constraint specifications, these can possibly be expressed as using SHACL
    language. </p><p/></section>
